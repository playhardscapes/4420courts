# 4420-Courts Project Documentation

## üìã **Project Overview**
- **Target Revenue**: $18-20k/month (15-17 courts)
- **Customer**: "Two guys & a pickup" + overwhelmed homeowners
- **Product**: Premium court resurfacing materials ($1,200-1,500/court)
- **Differentiator**: Professional support + troubleshooting content

## üõí **E-commerce Platform Decision**

### **Chosen Solution: Shopify + Customer Portal**
- **Plan**: Start with Shopify Basic ($29/month), scale to Advanced ($399/month) at volume
- **Sales Tax**: TaxJar integration ($19-99/month)
- **At $20k/month**: Total cost ~$879/month (4.4% vs Amazon's 15%)

### **Why Not Amazon Marketplace**
- Commodity pricing race to bottom
- 15% commission too expensive at scale
- No brand control or customer relationships
- Wrong for premium positioning

## üì¶ **Product Strategy**

### **Primary Products**
1. **Complete Court Kit** - $1,200-1,500
   - 20x 5-gallon buckets (4 gallons material each)
   - 80 gallons total covers one court
   - Cost basis: ~$500 for materials

2. **Service Add-ons**
   - White Glove Delivery + Demo: $200-300
   - Video Consultation: $150/hour
   - Emergency Support: $200 flat fee

### **Pricing Strategy**
- **One retail price for everyone** (no bulk discounts)
- **Premium materials** justify premium pricing
- **Service-based differentiation** vs. competitors

## üîí **Premium Support Portal (Post-Purchase Paywall)**

### **Technical Implementation**
- **Platform**: Shopify Customer Account Portal + Private Vimeo
- **Cost**: $20/month for Vimeo Pro
- **Access**: Automatic after purchase via customer account tags

### **Content Strategy Split**

**Public YouTube (Perfect World):**
- How to prep perfect surface
- Ideal weather application
- Standard mixing procedures
- Basic tool usage

**Premium Portal (Real World Problems):**
- 10 Common Mistakes & How to Fix Them
- Weather delay protocols
- Application mistake recovery
- Temperature swing management

### **Support Tier Structure**
1. **Portal Access** (included with purchase)
2. **Video Consultation** (FREE 15 min for customers, then $100/hour)
3. **Emergency Support** ($200 same-day response)

## üéØ **Target Market Positioning**
- **Not DIYers**: Too complex for pure DIY
- **Not big contractors**: They have their own vendors
- **Sweet spot**: Small contractors, handymen, ambitious homeowners
- **Value prop**: Professional results without full contractor cost

## üöö **Future Expansion Ideas**
- **Delivery service** in 2-3 states
- **Certified installer network** (no discounts, just referrals)
- **15-minute on-site demos** with delivery

3. **Real-world problem solving** content
